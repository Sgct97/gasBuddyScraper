# GasBuddy Reconnaissance Report

## Objective
Map GasBuddy's complete architecture to determine optimal scraping strategy for 150K+ stations, 2x daily.

## Tasks

### 1. Network Traffic Analysis
- [ ] Capture API endpoints using browser DevTools
- [ ] Identify authentication/headers required
- [ ] Document request/response structure
- [ ] Check for GraphQL vs REST
- [ ] Test if data is in initial HTML or loaded via JS

### 2. URL Structure Mapping
- [ ] Station detail pages: pattern?
- [ ] Search results: how are they structured?
- [ ] Geographic hierarchy: state > city > station?
- [ ] Sitemap.xml availability?

### 3. Anti-Bot Measures
- [ ] Cloudflare detection
- [ ] Rate limiting thresholds
- [ ] CAPTCHA triggers
- [ ] Browser fingerprinting
- [ ] TLS fingerprinting

### 4. Data Coverage
- [ ] How many US states/cities covered?
- [ ] Station density per major market
- [ ] Total station count estimation
- [ ] Price update frequency patterns

### 5. Alternative Approaches
- [ ] Mobile app API (often less protected)
- [ ] RSS feeds or public data exports
- [ ] Hidden API documentation
- [ ] Partnership/commercial API options
